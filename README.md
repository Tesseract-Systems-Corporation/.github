# Tesseract Systems Corporation

Tesseract Systems Corporation is a government technology company that builds and delivers software platforms used to operate mission-critical public-sector systems.

We focus on systems that must work every day, withstand audit and oversight, and remain operable long after the original contract has ended.

## What We Build

We design and maintain software platforms that support core government operations, including:

- Human services systems, including child welfare, child support, and judicial and benefits workflows  
- Public transparency and civic-facing systems  
- Legacy data modernization and cross-system integration  
- Security, compliance, and operational governance tooling  

These are not experimental products. They are production systems intended to be owned, operated, and maintained by public agencies over long time horizons.

## Engineering Principles

- **Product-led, not project-driven**  
  Systems are designed to persist beyond individual contracts, staff changes, and procurement cycles.

- **Security by design**  
  Auditability, access control, and compliance requirements are treated as baseline conditions, not optional features.

- **Ownership and portability**  
  Platforms are deployable on government-controlled infrastructure and do not rely on vendor lock-in to remain operable.

- **Clarity over novelty**  
  Preference is given to straightforward, maintainable architectures over unnecessary complexity or trend-driven tooling.

## Repositories

This organization contains a combination of public, private, and internal repositories.  
Production systems are not broadly open-sourced and are maintained according to contractual and operational requirements.
